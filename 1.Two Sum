Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?

Answer:
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        dic = {} #create a dictionary
        #use enumerate to convert input list to [(0,'2'),(1,'7'),(2,'9')], assign index in i and value in num
        for i, num in enumerate(nums): 
            print(i,num)
            #get the remainder
            reminder = target - num 
            #if remainder not found in dic, add it in dic[2]=0
            if(reminder not in dic): 
                dic[num] = i
            else:
                #if found, return [index of remainder, current index]   
                return [dic[reminder],i]
